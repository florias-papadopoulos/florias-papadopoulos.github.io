## ❖ Abstract

This study was made for an assignment of the class ”Elliptic-Curve Cryptography” of my master’s. <br>
For the assignment, the Signal Protocol (as described in [\[1\]](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/), [\[2\]](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/), [\[3\]](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/), [\[4\]](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/sesame/)), had to be studied, analyzed and presented in a more explanatory and student-friendly way. <br>
