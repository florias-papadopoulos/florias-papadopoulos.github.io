## ❖ General Information

This work navigates the evolving world of post-quantum cryptography, particularly focusing on lattice-based cryptographic constructions. Starting with a thorough exploration of fundamental lattice concepts, the study progresses to delve into well-known hard lattice problems and the algorithms attempting to solve them. Afterwards, the focus is shifted to Learning with Errors (LWE), providing a comprehensive examination of LWE theory, its applications, and a concise study of Ring-LWE, a variant that provides more efficient constructions. The conclusion unfolds with an in-depth exploration of CRYSTALS-Kyber, a cryptographic scheme whose security is based on the hardness of solving hard lattice problems in (module) lattices. Beginning with the necessary preliminaries, we then delve into a detailed analysis of Kyber and its security, finishing with a recent real-world application of the scheme, the X25519Kyber768 hybrid KEM that is used to fortify Google Chrome’s security.
