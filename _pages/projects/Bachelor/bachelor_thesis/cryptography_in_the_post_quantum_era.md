## ❖ Abstract

In this thesis, I explore Cryptography in the Post-Quantum era, addressing the impending threat of quantum computers to communication security. I begin by examining Cryptography techniques and gradually delve into Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing, emphasizing Post-Quantum Cryptography as the most promising solution. I analyze two key families: Hash-based Cryptography and Code-Based Cryptography, discussing their schemes, strengths, weaknesses, and security levels. For this purpose, I also provide a concise introduction to Coding Theory. The study concludes by exploring initiatives by organizations like NIST and ANSSI to counter the quantum threat, bridging theory and practical implementation for the future. 

The thesis was presented on [Seminar on Theoretical Computer Science and Discrete Mathematics](https://users.auth.gr/grahonis/Seminar_TCS.html) on March 2022.
