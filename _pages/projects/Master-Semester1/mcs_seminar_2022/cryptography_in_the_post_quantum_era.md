## ‚ùñ Abstract

üìç This presentation was made for my participation in the [Graduate Seminars](https://sites.google.com/view/studentseminar-mathauth-en/home) of the Mathematics Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 

In this speech, I begin by introducing basic concepts from the fields of Cryptography and Quantum Computing, with the aim of analyzing the so-called "Quantum Threat" to Cryptography. Then, I proceed by presenting the main approach to addressing this threat, which is Post-Quantum Cryptography, and analyzing it by describing some families of cryptographic schemes and systems that belong to it, in particular some of those belonging to the fields of Hash-Based Cryptography, Code-Based Cryptography & Lattice Cryptography. Finally, the speech concludes with a reference to current and future perspectives and actions of organizations actively involved in the topic, in order to provide a global outlook on the subject.
