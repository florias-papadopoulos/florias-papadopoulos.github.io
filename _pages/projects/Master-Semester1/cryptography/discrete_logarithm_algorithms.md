## ❖ Abstract

In the context of computational exercises assigned in class, we had to use Shanks' algorithm (also named Baby-step Giant-step algorithm,), Adleman's algorithm, discrete Pollard's algorithm (otherwise known as Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms) and Pohlig-Hellman algorithm (also named Index calculus algorithm) for calculating the discrete logarithm of a number (mine was ).
