    "# Euclidean Attack on RSA\n",
    "\n",
    "This program was made for an assignment of the class ”Cryptography” of my master’s program considering the study of the Euclidean Attack on RSA, as described on \"An Attack on Small Private Keys of RSA Based on Euclidean Algorithm\" of D. Poulakis, which can be found [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/283).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although more theoretical analysis has been done on another file, our main goal here is to create a program that can emulate the \"EUCLID-ATTACK\" algorithm for the factorization of n, proposed in the same paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**EUCLID-ATTACK**</u>  \n",
    "$\\cdot$ Input: An RSA public key $(n,e)$ with $e > n \\, / \\, c$  \n",
    "$\\cdot$ Output: The primes $p$ and $q$ (or FAIL)\n",
    "1. Compute $a=(n+1) \\, mod \\, e$\n",
    "2. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm for $e$ and $a$, compute the biggest remainder $r_j$ among them which are $<e^{3/4}$,  \n",
    "   as well as the associated integers $s_j, t_j$ such that $s_je+at_j=r_j$.\n",
    "3. Compute $\\mu_j = gcd(t_j,r_j)$ and next $t'_j=t_j \\, / \\, \\mu_j$.\n",
    "4. Compute $\\beta_1 = (a+|t'_j|^{-1}) \\, mod \\, e$ and next the solutions $u_1$ and $v_1$ of equation $x^2-\\beta_1x+n=0$.  \n",
    "   If $u_1$ and $v_1$ are positive integers, then output $(u_1, v_1)$. Otherwise, go to the next step.\n",
    "5. Compute $\\beta_2 = (a+(e-|t'_j|)^{-1}) \\, mod \\, e$ and next the solutions $u_2$ and $v_2$ of equation $x^2-\\beta_2x+n=0$.  \n",
    "   If $u_2$ and $v_2$ are positive integers, then output $(u_2, v_2)$. Otherwise, output FAIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes:\n",
    "1. One change that we will make to the algorithm in our implementation is that the output will be more than the end results. We would also like to compute the inbetween values used. This is why we will compute both $(u_1, v_1)$ and $(u_2, v2)$, even if $(u_1, v_1)$ is already the right answer.  \n",
    "2. Due to some coding issues concerning the nature of the solutions $(u_1, v_1)$ and $(u_2, v2)$ of the above quadratic equations for large numbers, small changes to the algorithm had to be made. More precisely, the validation process to see if the solutions are indeed the primes $p$ and $q$ will now be a check to see if $int(u_1)\\cdot int(v_1)=n$ or $int(u_2) \\cdot int(v_2)=n$ respectively, where $int()$ is a python function used to convert a specified value (any number or string) into an integer object. Hence, $(int(u_1), int(v_1))$ or $(int(u_2),int(v_2))$ will be output respectively in each case.\n",

Classical self-made codes could not give an accurate enough result for the validation, so the functions \"solve()\" and \"N()\" from SymPy were used. More precisely, \"N()\" was used with the option 100 after solve, which means that the numerical evaluation of the result of solve is performed to an accuracy of 100 decimal digits, in order to make sure that all digits will be intact in the procedures. If there is a problem with the algorithm, one should first try to upper this option and then try other changes."
