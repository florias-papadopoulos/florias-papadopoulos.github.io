## ❖ Abstract

This report aims to present a student-friendly and explanatory overview of the paper "An application of Euclidean algorithm in cryptanalysis of RSA" [\[1\]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/283). It consists of two chapters: a theoretical chapter that thoroughly explains the main concepts of the paper, and a practical chapter that provides an explanation and implementation of the EUCLID-ATTACK algorithm proposed in [\[1\]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/283). The implementation was carried out using Python, and an accompanying executable program was created for creating toy examples of the algorithm's application. However, the executable has not been uploaded on the site, one can only see the code for executing EUCLID-ATTACK in the .ipynb file below.
