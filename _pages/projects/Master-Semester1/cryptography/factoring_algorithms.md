## ❖ Abstract

In the context of computational exercises assigned in class, we had to use the following:
- Dixon's algorithm
- Pollard's p-1 algorithm
- Pollard's rho algorithm
for the factorization of a number (mine was $n=902831$). These algorithms play a vital role in breaking down large numbers into their prime factors, a crucial step in modern encryption and decryption techniques.
