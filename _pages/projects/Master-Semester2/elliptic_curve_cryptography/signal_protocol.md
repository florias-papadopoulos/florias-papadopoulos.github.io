## ❖ Abstract

This study was made for an assignment of the class ”Elliptic-Curve Cryptography” of my master’s. <br>
For the assignment, the Signal Protocol (as described in [1](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/), [2](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/), [3](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/), [4](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/sesame/)), had to be studied, analyzed and represented in a more explanatory and student-friendly way. <br>
