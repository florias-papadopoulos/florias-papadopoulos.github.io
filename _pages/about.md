👨🏻‍💻 My name is Florias Papadopoulos (Φλωριάς Παπαδόπουλος). <br>
I am currently a doctoral researcher at the “Cybersecurity and Applied Cryptography” lab, under the supervision of Prof. Katerina Mitrokotsa, at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland (HSG).

🔬 My current research interests lie in provable security, post-quantum cryptography, and privacy-preserving protocols, with a particular focus on designing secure and efficient systems for **proximity tracking** and **collision avoidance**.

📚 As for my previous education, I obtained both my BSc degree in “Mathematics” and my MSc degree in “Theoretical Computer Science and Control Theory” at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece (AUTh).
